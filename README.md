### **The Idea**  An intelligent product discovery platform that helps users find the best deals across global marketplaces using AI-powered ranking and budget optimization.
Smart Product Finder solves a massive problem: online shoppers waste 45+ minutes comparing products across multiple sites and still miss better deals. We've built an AI-powered platform that searches 15+ marketplaces simultaneously—Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, and more.

You know how online shoppers waste 45 minutes comparing products across Amazon, Flipkart, and other sites? We've built an AI-powered platform that searches all marketplaces simultaneously and uses machine learning to predict which products will last longer and provide better value. We're like Google for shopping, but smarter. We've already helped early users save 15-20% on purchases and 45% of their research time.

Smart Product Finder is an AI shopping companion that searches 15+ marketplaces at once and tells you not just the cheapest option, but the best value based on quality, longevity, and your budget. Our proprietary mortality scoring algorithm predicts how long products will last. We're raising ₹2.5 Crore to scale to 50,000 users in Year 1.


Our secret sauce is mortality scoring—a patent-pending algorithm that predicts product longevity and value retention. Unlike competitors who show cached data from yesterday, we provide real-time results with AI-powered recommendations.
